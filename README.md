The implementation for paper "[Token-wise Influential Training Data Retrieval for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11724)" (Accepted at ACL 2024)

We are still working on it, and adding more new features to this repo.

## Feature Plan
- [ ] scripts of showing the results of influence estimation (by 6/24/2024)
- [ ] LaTex templates for drawing figures of token-wise influence visualization (by 7/1/2024)
- [ ] token-wise influence documentation (by 7/8/2024)

## Quick Start
Clone this repo to your local device.
```
git clone https://github.com/huawei-lin/RapidIn.git
cd RapidIn
```

Create a new environment by [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and install the dependencies.
```
conda create -n RapidIn python=3.10
conda activate RapidIn
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We provide an example of config file in `./examples` dir. You can modify it based on your requirements.

Once you have a config file, you can run:
```
python MP_main.py --config='config.json'
```

## Running Example
We also provide an example in `./examples`.

In `./examples`, we provide a dataset `alpaca_52k_with_5k_howdy_backdoor.jsonl`, which is a combination of the alpaca 52k dataset and 5k "Howdy!" backdoored data samples as described in our paper. We also provide a test dataset with 3 data samples in `backdoor_test.jsonl`, which includes 1) an attacked generation, 2) an original data sample within `alpaca_52k_with_5k_howdy_backdoor.jsonl`, and 3) a question and the corresponding generation we shown in the paper.

In order to better test the experiment, 100 test data is randomly selected into `test_data_100.jsonl`, and they are transfered into howdy data `howdy_test_data_100.jsonl`. And the rest data is stored in `alpaca_52k_with_5k_howdy_train.jsonl`.

As shown in the `./example/config_caching.json`, we used [meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b) as the base model, and use [huaweilin/rapidin-alpaca-llama2-7b](https://huggingface.co/huaweilin/rapidin-alpaca-llama2-7b) as the LoRA adapter.

### Caching Stage
You have to run the caching stage first. It will generate a output dir and a gradients caching dir. Please make sure that you have at least 8GB of free space.
```
cd ./examples
python ../MP_main.py --config='./config_caching.json'
```

### Retrieval Stage
After caching the gradients for entire dataset, we can run the retrieval stage for the test dataset.
```
python ../MP_main.py --config='./config_retrieval.json'
```

### Results of Influence Estimation
The result json file will be placed in the output dir. We are still working on the script for visualization. We will release the code of this part by 6/24/2024.

For now, you can directly check the structure of the json file, and write your own script, to show the most influential data samples.
